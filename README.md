# End-to-end-data-warehouse-sqlserver
A complete end-to-end Modern Data Warehouse project built on Microsoft SQL Server, showcasing the design and implementation of a scalable data platform — from raw data ingestion to analytics-ready datasets.


# 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a robust data warehouse solution using SQL Server. It includes:

✅ Data Modeling – Star schema and dimensional modeling for analytical queries.

🔄 ETL Processes – Clean, transform, and load raw data into the warehouse using T-SQL and stored procedures.

📦 Data Warehouse Design – Layered architecture (Staging, Data Warehouse, and Data Marts).

📈 Analytics & Reporting – Pre-built analytical queries and views for BI tools like Power BI.


# Architecture

Source Systems → Staging Area → Data Warehouse (Dimensional Model) → Data Marts → Analytics Layer

    Staging Layer – Temporary storage for raw data.

    Data Warehouse Layer – Central repository designed using a star schema with fact and dimension tables.

    Data Marts – Subject-specific data subsets for faster analytics.

    Analytics Layer – Ready-to-use views and queries for dashboards and reporting.

# ⚙️ ETL Workflow

Data ingestion from ERP and CRM in CSV format.

Data transformation and validation using T-SQL scripts.

Incremental loading and change data capture (CDC) patterns.

Scheduled loads via SQL Server Agent.


# 📊 Project Objectives

E-commerce sales data integrated from multiple sources.

Warehouse built to support KPIs like revenue trends, product performance, customer segmentation and behaviour, etc.

Reports consumed by Power BI dashboards.


# 🛠️ Tech Stack

SQL Server 2019+ – Core database and warehouse engine

T-SQL – ETL and transformation scripting

SSMS – Development and management

(Optional) Power BI – Visualization and reporting


# 📚 Future Enhancements

Integration with Azure Data Factory for automated pipelines

Real-time data ingestion using CDC

Advanced analytics with Python or Power BI
