# end-to-end-data-warehouse-sqlserver
A complete end-to-end Modern Data Warehouse project built on Microsoft SQL Server, showcasing the design and implementation of a scalable data platform â€” from raw data ingestion to analytics-ready datasets.

# ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a robust data warehouse solution using SQL Server. It includes:

âœ… Data Modeling â€“ Star schema and dimensional modeling for analytical queries.

ðŸ”„ ETL Processes â€“ Clean, transform, and load raw data into the warehouse using T-SQL and stored procedures.

ðŸ“¦ Data Warehouse Design â€“ Layered architecture (Staging, Data Warehouse, and Data Marts).

ðŸ“ˆ Analytics & Reporting â€“ Pre-built analytical queries and views for BI tools like Power BI.

# Architecture
Source Systems â†’ Staging Area â†’ Data Warehouse (Dimensional Model) â†’ Data Marts â†’ Analytics Layer

    Staging Layer â€“ Temporary storage for raw data.

    Data Warehouse Layer â€“ Central repository designed using a star schema with fact and dimension tables.

    Data Marts â€“ Subject-specific data subsets for faster analytics.

    Analytics Layer â€“ Ready-to-use views and queries for dashboards and reporting.
